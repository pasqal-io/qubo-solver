## Providing feedback, requesting features and filing bugs

We're very interested in your feedback!

The best way to request a change, whether it's an improvement, a new feature or a bugfix, is through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/pasqal-io/maximum-independent-set/issues). Before filing a new issue, don't forget to search if there's already an issue on the same topic.

If you're willing to help getting that issue resolved, that's even better! See the next section.


## Opening Pull Requests

We're grateful for your [Pull Requests](https://github.com/pasqal-io/maximum-independent-set/pulls) (i.e. submissions) to the code, documentation, tutorials, even this document!

Before your first Pull Request, you'll need to:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/pasqal-io/maximum-independent-set/fork) the repository;
2. Clone your forked repository locally, either through the GitHub console, or
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/maximum-independent-set.git
$ cd maximum-independent-set
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/pasqal-io/maximum-independent-set.git
```
3. [Setup your development environment](./first%20contact.md#hatch-instructions).

Before you open a Pull Request, please make sure that you have:

- read the [contributor agreement](../CONTRIBUTOR%20AGREEMENT.md)
- followed [all the testing instructions](./first%20contact.md#running-tests).


Our testing infrastructure will check whether your changes to the code or documentation break anything. If they don't, this will start the review cycle, during which we'll discuss with you to understand the purpose of your change, fix any issue and, hopefully, get your code merged!


## One word about patents

The domain of Quantum Computing is heavily patented. If you contribute a new quantum algorithm (and not just an improvement to the library), please make sure that it's not covered by a patent!
